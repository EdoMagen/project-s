                        We've started at late 2014 after reviewing <strong>several</strong> paid services to do what now SwanScreen does, <br/>
                        we wanted to create something better, and not charge as much for it, or even not at all. slowly but surely - we grew.<br/>
                        today we have thousands of users each month, some have an event like a wedding or a birthday party, or even a corporate event,<br/>
                        and some more frequent users like bars, restaurants and coffeeshops worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SwanScreen is a live social media feed, including tweets, image tweets, instagram photos and instagram videos.<br/>
                        We're very open to suggestions and if you have anything you want us to add to SwanScreen - <a href="mailto:swanscreen@gmail.com" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'About us', 'click', 'email us link');">email us</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/swanscreen" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'About us', 'click', 'facebook link');">message us on facebook</a><br/><br/>
